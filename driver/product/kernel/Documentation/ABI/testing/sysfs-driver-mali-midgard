Description:	This is used to get a description of the present Mali GPU, which
		includes the GPU family, the number of cores, the hardware
		version and the raw product id.
		For example: Mali-T60x MP4 r0p0 0x6956

		purposes.
		Reads show the current core mask and the mask of cores available.
		Writes set the current core mask.

What:		/sys/class/misc/mali0/device/js_timeouts
Date:		August 2020
Contact:	Tom Whalley <tom.whalley@arm.com>
Description:	This is used to override the current job scheduler values for
		- JS_STOP_STOP_TICKS_SS
		- JS_STOP_STOP_TICKS_CL
		- JS_HARD_STOP_TICKS_SS
		- JS_HARD_STOP_TICKS_CL
		- JS_HARD_STOP_TICKS_DUMPING
		- JS_RESET_TICKS_SS
		- JS_RESET_TICKS_CL
		- JS_RESET_TICKS_DUMPING.
		This file contains five values separated by whitespace. The
		values are basically the same as:
		%JS_SOFT_STOP_TICKS, %JS_HARD_STOP_TICKS_SS, %JS_HARD_STOP_TICKS_DUMPING, %JS_RESET_TICKS_SS, %JS_RESET_TICKS_DUMPING
		configuration values (in that order), with the difference that
		the js_timeout values are expressed in MILLISECONDS.

		Writing to it allows the current values in use by the job
		scheduler to get override. Note that a value needs to be other
		than 0 for it to override the current job scheduler value.
		Reading returns the last set values written to this file. If the
		file didn't get written yet, the values will be current setting
		in use.

What:		/sys/class/misc/mali0/device/js_scheduling_period
Date:		August 2020
Contact:	Tom Whalley <tom.whalley@arm.com>
Description:	The js_scheduling_period values are expressed in MILLISECONDS.
		Writing updates the JS scheduling period value.
		Reading returns the current period used for the JS scheduling
		period.

What:		/sys/class/misc/mali0/device/reset_timeout
Date:		August 2020
Contact:	Tom Whalley <tom.whalley@arm.com>
Description:	The reset_timeout value is expressed in MILLISECONDS.
		This file is used to update or get the reset timeout.

What:		/sys/class/misc/mali0/device/soft_job_timeout
Date:		August 2020
Contact:	Tom Whalley <tom.whalley@arm.com>
Description:	Writes allows setting the timeout for software jobs.
		Reads return the current timeout value.
		Waiting soft event wait jobs will be cancelled after this period
		expires, while soft fence wait jobs will print debug information
		if the fence debug feature is enabled.
		Timeout is expressed in milliseconds.

What:		/sys/class/misc/mali0/device/js_ctx_scheduling_mode
Date:		August 2020
Contact:	Tom Whalley <tom.whalley@arm.com>
Description:	This file is used to update or get the context scheduling mode
		being used by Job Scheduler, available values are: 0 or 1;
		- 0, called SYSTEM_PRIORITY_MODE
		  In this mode, higher priority atoms will be scheduled first,
		  regardless of the context they belong to. Newly-runnable
		  higher priority atoms can preempt lower priority atoms
		  currently running on the GPU, even if they belong to a
		  different context.
		- 1, called LOCAL_PRIORITY_MODE
		  In this mode, the highest-priority atom will be chosen fro
		  each context in turn using a round-robin algorithm, so
		  priority only has an effect within the context an atom belongs
		  to. Newly-runnable higher priority atoms can preempt the lower
		  priority atoms currently running on the GPU, but only if they
		  belong to the same context.

What:		/sys/class/misc/mali0/device/scheduling/serialize_jobs
Date:		August 2020
Contact:	Tom Whalley <tom.whalley@arm.com>
Description:	This file is used to update the serialization setting for the
		submission of GPU jobs. The available values are:
		- "none"
		  Disable job serialization, the default mode.
		- "intra-slot"
		  Serialize atoms within a slot (ie only one atom per job slot).
		- "inter-slot"
		  Serialize atoms between slots (ie only one job slot running at
		  any time).
		- "full"
		  Equal to "intra-slot" + "inter-slot"
		- "full-reset"
		  Beside "full", reset the GPU after each atom completion.

What:		/sys/class/misc/mali0/device/force_replay
Date:		August 2020
Contact:	Tom Whalley <tom.whalley@arm.com>
Description:	Control the job replay, possible settings: limit=<limit>,
		random_limit, norandom_limit, core_req=<core_req>.

What:		/sys/class/misc/mali0/device/power_policy
Date:		August 2020
Contact:	Tom Whalley <tom.whalley@arm.com>
Description:	This is used for obtaining information about the available power
		policies, determining which policy is currently active, and
		changing the active policy.
		Reads list the available policies with the currently active one
		surrounded by square brackets.
		Writes change the current policy to the requrested one, the
		requsted policy must be one of the available policies returned
		by reading, or it will be ignored.

		- gpu_poweroff_time
		  the period of the poweroff timer, in ns.
		- poweroff_shader_ticks
		  the number of poweroff timer ticks before an idle shader is
		  powered off.
		- poweroff_gpu_ticks
		  the number of poweroff timer ticks before the GPU is powered
		  off.
